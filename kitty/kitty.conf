# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,

# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.

# For example:
# map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout
#
# You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below:

# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
