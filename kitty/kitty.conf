# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

# things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good.
# But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in your
# editor, it will not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a background color
# in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the terminals

#
# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
#
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout

# Clipboard
map ctrl+shift+v        paste_from_clipboard
map ctrl+shift+s        paste_from_selection
map ctrl+shift+c        copy_to_clipboard
map shift+insert        paste_from_selection
# You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any program using
# pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's open program is used, but
# you can specify your own, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+o      pass_selection_to_program firefox
map ctrl+shift+o        pass_selection_to_program

# Scrolling

# You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window mutt
#
# You can pass the current selection to the new program by using the @selection placeholder
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window less @selection
#
# You can even send the contents of the current screen + history buffer as stdin using
# the placeholders @text (which is the plain text) and @ansi (which includes text styling escape codes)
# For example, the following command opens the scrollback buffer in less in a new window.
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window @ansi less +G -R
#
# You can open a new window with the current working directory set to the
# working directory of the current window using
# map ctrl+alt+enter    new_window_with_cwd

# map ctrl+alt+1          goto_tab 1
# map ctrl+alt+2          goto_tab 2

# Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of arbitrary

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols


# OS specific tweaks

# Hide the kitty window's title bar on macOS.
macos_hide_titlebar no

# Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will use
# the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This will
# break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal programs, but you
# can use the macOS unicode input technique.
macos_option_as_alt yes

# The number is a percentage of maximum volume.
# See man XBell for details.
x11_bell_volume 80

# Prefer color emoji fonts when available. Note that this only works
# on systems such as Linux that use fontconfig. On other OSes, the emoji
# font used is system dependent. It can be overriden using symbol_map in the kitty
# configuration.
prefer_color_emoji yes
