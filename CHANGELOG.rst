Changelog
==============

version 0.4.0 [future]
-----------------------

- Refactor kitty's internals to make it even faster and more efficient. The
  CPU usage of kitty + X server while doing intensive tasks such as scrolling
  a file continuously in less has been reduced by 50%. There are now two
  configuration options ``repaint_delay`` and ``input_delay`` you can use to
  fine tune kitty's performance vs CPU usage profile. The CPU usage of kitty
  + X when scrolling in less is now better than most (all?) other terminals.

- Hovering over URLs with the mouse now underlines them to indicate they
  can be clicked. Hold down Ctrl+Shift while clicking to open the URL.

- Selection using the mouse is now more intelligent. It does not add
  blank cells (i.e. cells that have no content) after the end of text in a
  line to the selection.

- The block cursor in now fully opaque but renders the character under it in
  the background color, for enhanced visibility.
