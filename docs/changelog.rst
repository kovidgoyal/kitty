.. recent major features {{{

Recent major new features
---------------------------

Sessions [0.43]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kitty has long had support for :doc:`sessions`, aka simple text files where you
can define what tabs, windows and programs you wish to run in kitty. Now in
addition to that kitty has the ability to :ref:`create and switch between
sessions <goto_session>` with a single keypress and also to manually setup some
tabs/windows in kitty and :ref:`save it as a session file <complex_sessions>`,
for seamless and intuitive session file creation.

A scrollbar for the kitty scrollback [0.43]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A long requested feature, kitty has finally :pull:`gotten a scrollbar <8945>`
that can be used with the mouse for browsing its scrollback. The bar appear
automatically when you start scrolling backwards and is :opt:`extensively
configurable <scrollbar>` in kitty.conf. Note that the old ``scrollback_indicator_opacity``
option is deprecated.

Multiple cursors [0.43]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kitty has pioneered a new :doc:`escape code protocol
<multiple-cursors-protocol>` that allows terminal applications to use multiple
cursors, rendered natively. These are typically used in editors to make the
same edit at multiple locations. Now terminal based editors can use properly
rendered native cursors, just like their GUI cousins, at last.

Access kitty with a single keypress [0.42]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: quake-screenshots.rst

kitty now has a Quake like floating, translucent terminal window, so you can access
all that kitty goodness instantly with a single keypress.

See the screenshots on the side and head over to the :doc:`kitten page for details
on how to set it up </kittens/quick-access-terminal>`.


Multiple sized text [0.40]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kitty is the first major terminal to introduce the concept of multiple sized
text. Terminal programs running in kitty can now opt-in to use and display text
in multiple font sizes both larger and smaller than the base font size. This is
done in a backwards compatible, opt-in way that does not affect how traditional
terminal programs work at all. For details on the new feature and how to use
it, see :doc:`text-sizing-protocol`.

Cursor trails [0.37]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show an animated trail when the text cursor makes large jumps making it easy
to follow cursor movements. Inspired by the similar feature in neovide, but
works with terminal multiplexers and kitty windows as well. See :pull:`the pull
request <7970>` for a demonstration video. This feature is optional and must be
turned on by the :opt:`cursor_trail` option in :file:`kitty.conf`.


Variable font support [0.36]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Terminal aficionados spend all day staring at text, so getting text
rendering just right is very important. In that spirit, kitty now supports
`OpenType Variable fonts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_font>`__.
These allow precise customisation of font characteristics, such as weight and
spacing. Not only that, kitty now has a new :doc:`choose-fonts
<kittens/choose-fonts>` kitten that provides a UI for choosing fonts with
support for font features, variable fonts and previews of how the font will
look. This is in addition to its existing best-in-class font customization
abilities, such as: :opt:`symbol_map`, :opt:`text_composition_strategy`,
:opt:`font_features` and :opt:`modify_font`. kitty knows text rendering is
important, and goes the extra mile for it.

Desktop notifications [0.36]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|kitty| now has a :doc:`notify </kittens/notify>` kitten that can be used to
display desktop notifications from the command line, even over SSH. It has
support for icons, buttons, updating notifications, waiting till
the notification is closed, etc. The underlying :doc:`desktop-notifications`
protocol has been expanded to support all these features.

Wayland goodies [0.34]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wayland users should rejoice as kitty now comes with major Wayland
quality-of-life improvements:

* Draw GPU accelerated :doc:`desktop panels and background </kittens/panel>`
  running arbitrary terminal programs. For example, run `btop
  <https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/>`__ as your desktop background

* Background blur for transparent windows is now supported under KDE
  using a custom KDE specific protocol

* The kitty window decorations in GNOME are now fully functional with buttons
  and they follow system dark/light mode automatically

* kitty now supports fractional scaling in Wayland which means pixel perfect
  rendering when you use a fractional scale with no wasted performance on
  resizing an overdrawn pixmap in the compositor

With this release kitty's Wayland support is now on par with X11, provided
you use a decent Wayland compositor.

Cheetah speed üêÜ [0.33]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

kitty has grown up and become a cheetah. It now parses data it receives in
parallel :iss:`using SIMD vector CPU instructions <7005>` for a 2x speedup in
benchmarks and a 10%-50% real world speedup depending on workload. There is a
new benchmarking kitten ``kitten __benchmark__`` that can be used to measure
terminal throughput. There is also :ref:`a table <throughput>` showing kitty is
much faster than other terminal emulators based on the benchmark kitten. While
kitty was already so fast that its performance was never a bottleneck, this
improvement makes it even faster and more importantly reduces the energy
consumption to do the same tasks.

  (:iss:`754`)

- Fix detection of URLs in HTML source code (URLs inside quotes) (:iss:`785`)

- Implement support for emoji skin tone modifiers (:iss:`787`)

- Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj

  and padding of the window.

- Add some non standard terminfo capabilities used by neovim and tmux.

- Fix large drop in performance when using multiple top-level windows on macOS

  texture cache on the GPU, further reducing overall resource usage. Use
  the shortcut `ctrl+shift+n` to open a new top-level window.

  kitty list-fonts

- Add an option to have window focus follow mouse

- Add a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+f11) to toggle fullscreen mode

- macOS: Fix handling of option key. It now behaves just like the alt key on
  Linux. There is an option to make it type unicode characters instead.

  hanging if the open program hangs when clicking on a URL.


0.4.0 [2017-10-22]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for drawing arbitrary raster graphics (images) in the terminal via a
  new graphics protocol. kitty can draw images with full 32-bit color using both
  ssh connections and files/shared memory (when available) for better
  performance. The drawing primitives support alpha blending and z-index.
  Images can be drawn both above and below text. See :doc:`graphics-protocol`.
  for details.

- Refactor kitty's internals to make it even faster and more efficient. The CPU
  usage of kitty + X server while doing intensive tasks such as scrolling a
  file continuously in less has been reduced by 50%. There are now two
  configuration options ``repaint_delay`` and ``input_delay`` you can use to
  fine tune kitty's performance vs CPU usage profile. The CPU usage of kitty +
  X when scrolling in less is now significantly better than most (all?) other
  terminals. See :doc:`performance`.

- Hovering over URLs with the mouse now underlines them to indicate they
  can be clicked. Hold down Ctrl+Shift while clicking to open the URL.

- Selection using the mouse is now more intelligent. It does not add
  blank cells (i.e. cells that have no content) after the end of text in a
  line to the selection.

- The block cursor in now fully opaque but renders the character under it in
  the background color, for enhanced visibility.

- Allow combining multiple independent actions into a single shortcut

- Add a new shortcut to pass the current selection to an external program

- Allow creating shortcuts to open new windows running arbitrary commands. You
  can also pass the current selection to the command as an arguments and the
  contents of the screen + scrollback buffer as stdin to the command.
