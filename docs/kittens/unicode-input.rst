In :guilabel:`Code` mode, you enter a unicode character by typing in the hex code for the
character and pressing enter, for example, type in ``2716`` and press enter to get
✖. You can also choose a character from the list of recently used characters by
typing a leading period and then the two character index and pressing Enter.

In :guilabel:`Name` mode you instead type words from the character name and use the arrow
keys/tab to select the character from the displayed matches. You can also type
a leading period and the index for the match if you don't like to use arrow
keys.
